## What is tensor?

Tensor is a small High Performance Computing cluster available to MEB
researchers. It replaces previous compute servers vector and scalar[1-4].

The tensor cluster consists of a login node (`tensor`) and seven compute nodes
(`tensor[1-7]`) with capable CPUs and fast local storage. A selection of
common software is preinstalled, and more can be added on request.

As on larger HPC systems, work is typically done by submitting jobs to a queue
system, where they will be processed in order.
